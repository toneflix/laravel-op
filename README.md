Laravel OP is a simple fork of Laravel that provides a set of tools to help you build your Laravel application faster and easier. It is a collection of useful classes, traits, and functions that I have found useful in my own projects. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features as I need them. I hope you find it useful too.

## Usage

To use this package you have to initialize it as a project using composer:

```bash
composer create-project toneflix-code/laravel-op
```
